4. `yarn start` to start server.

Tasked with removing and reimagining a backend for a legacy codebase.  
This legacy codebase was a micro service which functioned as a tool to allow users to arrange lodging for available properties throughout the year.
The front-end for this micro service is linked here https://github.com/thefabfour/booking-service
